### Issue Bidder

#### Get more people involved with your issues, for sure.

Since we live in a fast, growing and busy world you don't have always time to fix important issues and you don't have always time to implement new things on existing systems. That's okay and that's just normal - even though they would be important. Here comes Issue Bidder in the game. We let you post an Issue created on GitHub so that not only you but also any other people they are interested in that issue, can offer any amount of money in the hope that an other developer can fix this.
<br><br>
The application is built with Symfony2 and makes among other things extensive use of the following API's:
<ul>
    <li>GitHub</li>
    <li>PayPal</li>
</ul>
The server setup is based on a personal created VPS server.
A NGINX webserver with a tailored configuration and SSL certificate brings the necessary performance and security.

### VKweb

#### A management and planing tool for the Verkehrskadetten ZÃ¼richsee.

VKweb is a school project (Software Engineering Project) together with 3 team members. As this is a Symfony2 project on server-side my role is also to lead the team in terms of technical decisions and the procedure of development.
<br><br>
As the customer was planing each event using multiple excel sheets the goal is to centralize each process into one application. This will prevent the customer redundancy and significantly decrease the amount of mistakes during the process.
Consequently this lets the customer plan an event more efficient.

Technologies:
<ul>
    <li>Server-Side: RESTful API using Symfony2</li>
    <li>Client-Side: AngularJS</li>
    <li>Projectmanagement: Atlassian JIRA/Confluence</li>
</ul>
