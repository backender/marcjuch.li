## Hostag

With interests in server administration, service quality and availability as well as the open source project [ISPConfig](http://ispconfig.org) we are maintaining a powerful hosting environment:

- 2 x Nameservers
- 1 x Mailservers
- 1 x Webservers
- X x VPS (Managed for clients)

We are specialized in providing individual hosting setups. Especially ambitious clients using Symfony appreciate a harmonized server/application environment

## Likeme
Likeme is the first project of Leo, <a href="http://mcalister.ch" target="_blank">Brian</a> and me after we've done our apprenticeship in computer science.
We haven't been working together for a while so we wanted to do something cool and just for fun. We've had a couple of coffees
at Starbucks and came up with the idea of Likeme - a little social network where users can simply like each other and then come in touch through facebook.

*Likeme was the first Symfony2 project for all of us. In the end it's of course a mess of code with a lot of bad practices but in this case it's not that bad.
We did this project to not only learn Symfony but also learn working together in a software project.*
