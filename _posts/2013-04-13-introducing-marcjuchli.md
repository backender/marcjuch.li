I've built this website for a couple of reasons which I categorized as follows:

**In general:**

- To be more structured
- To improve my english skills
- To improve my writing skills

**About:**

- Have a contact information website in CV style with a summary about my education, skills, work experience and more.

**Projects:**

- Have a central page to document my personal projects

**Refernces:**

- Have a central page to show work I've done in past

**Publications:**

- Share my publications (for open source communities)

**Blog:**

- Have a platform to archive and document issues during my development days
- To help other people with same issues
- Present new and interesting stuff

I think writing has a lot to do with beeing structured and productive. This blog should improve the mentioned skills.


## Built with
