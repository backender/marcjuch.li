{% include JB/setup %}

In this blog post I'd like to show a straight forward way of using Google CSE within your Symfony application. 

As an example we implement a search functinoality on top of a magazine archive (already given in this tutorial). In our case we have a magazine archive, but this could also be anthing other. The only important thing is a **public** detail view of ever magazine with it's **unique URL**. in this post we use: {% highlight bash %} http://example.com/detail/123 {% endhighlight %} , where 123 means the unique magazine number.

*To be honest - this is a big limitation but as the title already mentions this should only display an example of how to use Google CSE. In our case this was an efficient way to offer a search functionality, since a separate serach engine (e.g. apache solr) was an overkill.*

## Parameters

First of all we define the neccessary parameters within the app/config/parameters.yml file. In this case we need:

* `google_cse_key`: YOURKEY 
  
	The key can be found in Google API Console: https://code.google.com/apis/console/ 

* `google_cse_cx`: YOURCX

	The cx id can be found here: https://www.google.com/cse/manage/all (it's contained in the url of your specific search engine).
	
## Index

So that Google knows what to search when we send a request, we have to configure cse and set an index. This can be done within the CSE management console (https://www.google.com/cse/manage/all). In this example we set the index to: 

{% highlight bash %}
http://example.com/archiv/detail/*
{% endhighlight %}

This means that the whole detail page of ever magazine will be indexed. And this means also that every content on this page will be recoginzed by Google, which is amazing. No configuration has to be done and the whole page is indexed.

## Form Type (Search Field)

Using Symfonys form compenent, the form type is used to build our form which is nothing more than a simple **input field**. Therefore the name of the field is **q** and it's type is **text**. As an optional argument we set required to false, since the user does not have to use the search field. 

{% highlight php %}
<?php
namespace Backender\SerachExampleBundle\Form\Type;

use Symfony\Component\Form\AbstractType;
use Symfony\Component\Form\FormBuilderInterface;

class ArchivSearchType extends AbstractType
{
    public function buildForm(FormBuilderInterface $formBuilder, array $options)
    {
        $formBuilder
            ->add('q', 'text', array(
                'required'  => false,
            ))
        ;
    }

    public function getName()
    {
        return 'archive_search';
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

##Â Repository

Now it time to define the logic to use Google as the search engine.
At this point a dependency is required to handle http requests. This can be installed using composer.

{% highlight bash %}
composer require kriswallsmith/buzz
composer update kriswallsmith/buzz
{% endhighlight %}

Next a Repository Class needs to be defined in our entity.

{% highlight php %}
<?php
namespace Backender\SearchExampleBundle\Entity;

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;

* @ORM\Entity(repositoryClass="Backender\SearchExampleBundle\Entity\MagazineRepository")

// entity stuff, not part of this tutorial

{% endhighlight %}

Let's define a function called **findByGoogle**. In general this function will go through three steps:

1. Send request to google with search string and further arguments
2. Extract magazine number from response
3. Get internal objects using the magazine numbers

**Part one** (see comment) 

The previously installed Buzz library will be used. A request to https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1 will be sent with the following url parameters:

- key, the google cse key
- cx, the google cx id
- q, which means the search string
- alt, defines the response format

Then a GET request will be submitted and it's response will be decoded to JSON.

**Part two** (see comment)

The only necessary thing from Google's response is the received **url**. The url contains our unique magazine number. In the code example, for every result the part behind the last "/" (slash) will be extracted and stored in "searchMagazines" (array). In our case this is exactly the magazine number.

**Part three** (see comment)

Using the query builder and the extracted magazine numbers the internal objects can be found within a select statement.

And that's it - using a simple request including the search string we have our wanted magazines.

{% highlight php %}
<?php
namespace Backender\SearchExampleBundle\Entity;

use Doctrine\ORM\EntityRepository;
use Buzz\Browser, Buzz\Client\Curl;

class MagazineRepository extends EntityRepository
{
	public function findByGoogle($options){

        // PART 1
        $curl = new Curl();
        $browser = new Browser($curl);
        $url = 'https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1';
        $url = $url.'?key='.$options['key'].'&cx='.$options['cx'].'&q='.$options['q'].'&alt='.$options['alt'];
        $response = $browser->get($url)->getContent();
        $response = json_decode($response);

        if(!empty($response->items)){
			
            // PART 2
            $searchMagazines = array();
            foreach($response->items as $item){
                array_push($searchMagazines, substr($item->link, strrpos($item->link, '/') + 1));
            }
			
            // PART 3
            $magazines = $this->getEntityManager()->createQueryBuilder();
            $magazines->select('m')
                ->from('Backender\SearchExampleBundle\Entity\Magazine', 'm')
                ->where('m.enabled = 1')
                ->andWhere($magazines->expr()->in('m.magazineNumber', ':m_array'))
                ->orderBy('m.magazineNumber', 'DESC')
                ->setParameter('m_array', $searchMagazines)
            ;
            return $magazines;

        } else {
            return null;
        }
    }
    
}

{% endhighlight %}


## Controller

The controller part is pretty simple, since the "heavy" stuff is alredy done in the repository class.

**Part one** (see comment) 

If a request was sent to the controller with a valid value for q (remember this is the search string), the previously created method "findByGoogle" will be called.

**Part two** (see comment)

Just return the results to the view.

{% highlight php %}
<?php
    /**
     * @Route("/search", name="search_example_archiv_search")
     * @Template()
     *
     * @param \Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request $request
     * @return \Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response
     */
    public function searchAction(Request $request)
    {
        $form = $this->createForm(new ArchivSearchType());
        $form->bind($request);
        $formData = $form->getData();
        $query = $formData['q'];

        if($query !== null){
            // Part 1
            $options = array(
                'key' => $this->container->getParameter('google_cse_key'),
                'cx' => $this->container->getParameter('google_cse_cx'),
                'q' => urlencode($query),
                'alt' => 'json',
            );

            $magazinesByGoogle = $this->getDoctrine()->getRepository('SearchExampleBundle:Magazine')->findByGoogle($options);
            
            Part 2
            if($magazinesByGoogle !== null) {
                $magazines = $magazinesByGoogle->getQuery()->getResult();;
                return array(
                    'magazines' => $magazines,
                );

            } else {
                //no results
                return $this->render('SearchExampleBundle:Archiv:search_empty.html.twig');
            }

        } else{
            //not searched, render all or say no results
            return $this->redirect($this->generateUrl('serach_example_archiv_index'));
        }

    }
{% endhighlight %}
